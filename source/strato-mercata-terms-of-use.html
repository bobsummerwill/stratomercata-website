<p>In order to process transactions via STRATO Mercata or on any other STRATO Mercata Product, you may be required to enter into a "Smart Contract", which contract is created to record the initial transfer of real-world assets on the Platform and any subsequent transfers thereto. A "Smart Contract" means a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code wherein the code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized STRATO Mercata blockchain network and the execution and transactions of which are trackable and irreversible. The Terms of Use for the relevant STRATO Mercata Product will specify when Smart Contracts will be required and related terms and conditions for their use.</p>

<h2>Beta Services</h2>

<p>From time to time, STRATO Mercata may make Beta services available to you. You may choose to try such Beta services or not in your sole discretion. Any use of Beta Services is subject to any additional Beta services terms provided by STRATO Mercata at the time the Beta Services are made available.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>STRATO Mercata makes money when you add a transaction to the STRATO Mercata blockchain.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that your acceptance of this Agreement is considered your acceptance of our transaction fees as follows:</p>

<p>Every transaction on a STRATO Mercata Product is subject to fees collected to support the STRATO Mercata Product. The Terms of Use for the specific STRATO Mercata Product will specify whether you are going to be charged a transaction fee. You hereby authorize the STRATO Mercata to initiate debits in your account in settlement of the transactions being made on the relevant STRATO Mercata Product, agree to pay STRATO Mercata any transaction fees being charged for the sale or purchase of the asset(s), and authorize STRATO Mercata to deduct such fees from your account directly. You agree and understand that all fees, commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the Smart Contracts on the STRATO Mercata blockchain network. Transaction fee charges may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).</p>

<p>By transacting on the STRATO Mercata blockchain network in respect of a particular STRATO Mercata Product and by using the corresponding Smart Contracts for that transaction, you hereby acknowledge, consent to, and accept all automated fees, commissions, and royalties for the transaction relating to the purchase and sale of any asset via a STRATO Mercata Product. You further consent to and agree to be bound by the Smart Contracts' execution and distribution of the fees, commissions, and royalties. When executing a Smart Contract in the capacity of a "Purchaser", you hereby waive any entitlement to fees, commissions, or royalties paid to another by operation of the Smart Contracts. When executing a Smart Contract in the capacity of a "Seller" in a Smart Contract, you hereby waive any entitlement to fees, commissions, or royalties paid to another by operation of the Smart Contracts.</p>

<p>You further authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., bank account) to avoid interruptions in your transactions and to facilitate easy payment for new transactions.</p>

<p>The Parties agree and understand that as the STRATO Mercata Marketplace is in Beta testing as of the date of this Agreement, all payments, fees, commissions, and royalties will be transferred, processed, or initiated through ACH/Wire transfer, Stripe, Paypal, or other similar means and thereafter recorded on the Smart Contract until the STRATO Mercata Marketplace activates capacity to collect payment information securely on-chain.</p>

<p>You cannot reverse, cancel, or change a transaction that has been marked as pending or complete. If your payment method has insufficient funds or if you reverse payment made by you to us, you authorize STRATO Mercata, at its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other linked payment methods in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel, correct, or reverse your transaction in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if we suspect that the transaction may involve money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime. STRATO Mercata is under no obligation to reinstate a transaction on the same terms as the cancelled, corrected, or reversed transaction.</p>

<p>We utilize links and other tools to connect users to third-party services and websites, including, but not limited to, AWS Cloud Platform to host STRATO Mercata and third-party payment processors to process USD payment between you and STRATO Mercata ("Third Party Services"). We have no control over these Third-Party Services, and in no event shall we be held responsible or liable for the accuracy, reliability, or contemporaneity of any third-party's services, content, or policies. Users who access or use a Third-Party Service through STRATO Mercata are solely responsible for complying with the terms and policies of these third parties.</p>

<p>In no event shall a description or reference to a third-party's product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement of such third-party product or service by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third-Party Service.</p>
