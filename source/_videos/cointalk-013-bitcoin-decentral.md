Bitcoin Decentral is Toronto Canada's first co-working space for Bitcoin and other disruptive technology innovations. We launched to hundreds of eager bitcoin fans who showed up to drink, celebrate crypto currency and check out our two new made in Canada Bitcoin ATM's.

We want to remind everyone that this is a weekly event, please come by next Wednesday to chat all things crypto - become a part of the Bitcoin Revolution!

BD will provide space for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, KryptoKit, CoinTalk, Ethereum, The Toronto Bitcoin Meetup, The Bitcoin Expo 2014: In Cryptography We Trust, and other disruptive technology innovation initiatives and businesses that desire to be immersed in a space with people of like-minds dedicated to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.
