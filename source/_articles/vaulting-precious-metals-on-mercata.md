At STRATO Mercata, we're redefining how you collect real-world assets. With our vault-backed staking for physical gold and silver, we've made it easier, safer, and more rewarding to own precious metals. Whether you're buying your first gram of gold or adding digital silver to your portfolio, you can trust that every fraction is backed by something real.

## Our Trusted Vaulting Partner

When you purchase digital gold or silver on Mercata, your metals are fully secured by physical reserves stored by BA Gold Enterprises Inc., our trusted vaulting partner based in New York City. BA Gold isn't just any vaulting service—it's the same vault used by Trax NYC, the jeweler-influencer who's captivated millions on TikTok with stunning gold and silver creations.

## How It Works

Hassle free collecting! Buy digital gold or silver on STRATO Mercata, and let BA Gold stores the exact equivalent in their vault, ensuring a one-to-one match between your digital assets and the physical metals, thanks to our blockchain. This means your collection isn't just numbers on a screen—it's real, tangible, and secure, all tracked with the transparency of our smart contracts. 

Because your gold and silver are vaulted in a world-class facility, you can rest easy knowing they're fully insured and audited monthly.

It gets better. After purchasing your digital precious metals, you can stake them through STRATO Mercata to earn rewards. Think about that for a second: you're not only holding one of the most stable assets in the world, but you're also earning yield on it. Yield is earned at 10% APY in CATA, our governance token, which can be redeemed for items for your every day life on the marketplace, allowing you to begin living unbanked, and on-chain.

## Security With Blockchain Technology

Vaulting through STRATO Mercata is about more than just security—it's about trust. We've taken the timeless value of gold and silver and paired it with the cutting-edge technology of blockchain to create a system that's modern, transparent, and rewarding. No hype. No empty promises. Just real metals with real value.

## Why Mercata's Vaulting Model is a Win

Collecting in gold and silver has always been smart, but STRATO Mercata makes it modern. With the added flexibility of staking rewards and the assurance of vault-backed security, we're giving you every reason to get excited about precious metals again with no surprises. Want to redeem your metals and hold them in your hand? No problem. Prefer to trade them within our marketplace? Go right ahead. At STRATO Mercata, you're always in control.
