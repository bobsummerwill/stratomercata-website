Stiftung Ethereum (commonly known in the English-speaking world as the Ethereum Foundation) is a non-profit company which was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland, on 13th July 2014 by Vitalik Buterin, Taylor Gerring and Mihai Alisie

Ethereum project legal activities which had previously been organized under the for-profit EthSuisse legal entity were quickly transitioned to the Stiftung after its formation in the aftermath of the "Red Wedding".

[B2Bhint.com](https://b2bhint.com) has [public information](https://b2bhint.com/en/company/ch/stiftung-ethereum--CHE-292.124.800) on the legal entity which shows the following timeline:

* ~~14th Jul 2014: Incorporation with Vitalik as "president of the committee of founding", Mihai as the "vicepresident of the committee of founding", Taylor as "member of the foundation board" and MUTARA Audit AG as "auditor"~~
* ~~23rd Jul 2014: Vitalik resigned as "president of the committee of founding" and reappointed in same role, Taylor resigned as "member of the Foundation Board" and reappointed in same role, Mihai resigned as "vicepresident of the committee of founding" and reappointed in same role~~
* ~~4th Aug 2015: Vitalik resigned as "president of the committee of founding" and reappointed in same role, Taylor resigned as "member of the Foundation Board", Mihai resigned as "vicepresident of the committee of founding", Lars appointed as "member of the Foundation Board", Vadim appointed as "member of the Foundation Board", Wayne appointed as "member of the Foundation Board"~~
* ~~17th Dec 2015: Vitalik resigned as "president of the committee of founding" and appointed as "member of the Foundation Board", Lars, Vadim and Wayne all resigned as "member of the Foundation Board"~~
* ~~26th July 2016: Ming appointed as "director"~~
* ~~21st Oct 2016: Vitalik resigned as "member of the Foundation Board" and reppointed as "president of the committee of founding".  Patrick appointed as member of the Foundation Board.  Ming appointed as "member of the Foundation Board director"~~
* ~~23rd Jan 2017: Vitalik resigned as "president of the committee of founding" and reappointed in same role~~
* ~~7th Jun 2018: Ming resigned as "member of the Foundation Board director", Aya appointed as "member of the Foundation Board director"~~
* ~~22nd May 2019: MUTARA Audit AG resigned as "auditor", Grant Thornton AG appointed as "auditor"~~
* ~~26th Jul 2019: Grant Thornton AG resigned as "auditor" and reappointed in the same role~~

There is a lot of "noise" in there, but ignoring hat-shuffling, it boils down to:

* 14th Jul 2014: Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie and Taylor Gerring founded the Ethereum Foundation, with [MUTARA Audit AG](https://mutara.ch/en/) as auditor
* 4th Aug 2015: [Taylor]('/people/taylor-gerring/') and [Mihai]('/people/mihai-alisie/') resign and are replaced by Lars Klawitter, Vadim Levitin and Wayne Hennessy-Barrett (the "professional board")
* 17th Dec 2015: [Lars]('/people/lars-klawitter/'), [Vadim]('/people/vadim-levitin/') and [Wayne]('/people/wayne-hennessy-barrett/') resign en-masse after getting Minged, leaving [Vitalik]('/people/vitalik-buterin/') as the sole board member for seven months.  See Nora for more on that.  It appears that the Foundation might have been in legal breach during this period as there were no domiciled (legally resident) Swiss board members during this period, which is a requirement.  [Mihai]('/people/mihai-alisie/') had been a resident.
* 26th July 2016: Ming Chan is appointed as the second board member. Swiss citizen, often resident.
* 21st Oct 2016: Patrick Storchenegger is appointed as the third board member. Another Swiss citizen and resident.
* 7th Jun 2018: [Ming]('/people/ming-chan/') resigns and is replaced by [Aya]('/people/aya-miyaguchi/').  This "paperwork" happened months after the actual switch, with [Ming]('/people/ming-chan/')'s final day being 31st Jan 2018)
* 22nd May 2019: [MUTARA Audit AG](https://www.grantthornton.ch/en/) replaced by [Grant Thornton AG](https://www.grantthornton.ch/en/) as auditor

For many years, [https://ethereum.org/foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190222044758/https://ethereum.org/foundation) was the only public information on the Ethereum Foundation.  As you can see from that snapshot in February 2019, as well as being totally inadequate, the information was also chronically outdated, with [Aya]('/people/aya-miyaguchi/') nowhere to be seen and with Jeff Wilcke still listed years after his departure.

They finally set up their (now useful) website, [https://ethereum.foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/), as part of the [https://ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) community reboot which [started in April 2019](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/04/30/beginning-a-new-ethereum-org).
