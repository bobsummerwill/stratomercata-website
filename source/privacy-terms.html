<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated: October 9, 2025</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of STRATO Mercata, Inc., a BVI company registered under the number 2179057 ("we," "our," "us", or "STRATO Mercata") on the collection, use, recordation, and disclosure of your information when you (i) sign up to use a STRATO Mercata account or service through https://www.STRATOMercata.com, the services, features, content, applications, and application protocol interfaces ("STRATO Mercata APIs"), or the STRATO Mercata mobile application products and related services we offer (collectively referred to as the "STRATO Mercata Site"); or (ii) record a transaction on the STRATO Mercata blockchain provided by STRATO Mercata in the course of using one of the STRATO Mercata Products referenced herein; or (iii) such other services that may be offered by STRATO Mercata from time to time (collectively (i), (ii) or (iii) shall be referred to as "Services"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites, products, or services, even if we provide links to them or them to us.</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. When running the Services, we follow a few fundamental principles:</p>

<p>We do our best to limit the collection of Personal Information (defined below).</p>

<p>We don't share your information with third parties except as needed to deliver you the Services, comply with the law, make STRATO Mercata better, protect our rights, or effectuate a business transfer.</p>

<p>We're not a huge, faceless corporation. We're just normal people trying to deliver an incredible experience. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please reach out to us at info@STRATOMercata.com.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last Date Updated" at the top of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit and will do our best to notify you. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms. Any use of STRATO Mercata after an amendment to our Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance to the revised or amended agreement.</p>

<h2>How You Accept This Policy</h2>

<p>By accessing or using the Services, signing up to use a STRATO Mercata account or service through STRATO Mercata.net, STRATO Mercata's APIs, or the STRATO Mercata mobile application, entering into an order form to use a STRATO Mercata Product, requesting to join our mailing list, or signing up for a demo, you agree to the use, disclosure, and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with our Privacy Policy, you should immediately stop access or use of our Services.</p>

<h2>What Information Does STRATO Mercata Collect?</h2>

<p>The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) ("Personal Information"), and (ii) non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) ("Non-Personal Information"). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type.</p>

<p>We may collect a variety of Personal Information, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your contact information, such as your first name, last name, date of birth, photograph, home address, email address, and telephone number when you sign up for our Services, mailing list, or request a demo;</li>
<li>Your identification information such as your social security, financial records, tax records, government issued identification documentation such as a passport, driver's license, state ID card, national ID card, and/or other information we deem necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations under financial or anti-money laundering laws.</li>
<li>Your institute's information such as an employer identification number, articles of incorporation to prove legal formation, and personal identification information for all beneficial owners holding interest of 10% or more in your institute.</li>
<li>Information from Third Party Services (defined below) that you explicitly give us access to and from public databases, credit bureaus, and identity verification partners; and</li>
<li>Your banking and accreditation information (although we use a third-party payment processor, as described below) and your billing address.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including analytics data including: (i) the IP address of the computer you use to access the Services; (ii) the type of browser software you are using; (iii) the operating system you are using; (iv) the date and time you access or use the Services; (v) the website address, if any, that linked you to our Services; (vi) the website address, if any, you leave our website and travel to; and (vii) other non-personally identifiable traffic data.</p>

<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>

<p><strong>When You Create a Sign Up At a STRATO Mercata Site, For Services, For Our Mailing List, or Request a Demo.</strong> If you sign up for our Services, we may request certain Personal Information. This may include contact information such as your name, organization, address, email address, social security/employer identification number, proof of legal entity formation, personal information for all material beneficial owners, financial records, banking information, photo, and telephone number.</p>

<h3>Information We Automatically Collect</h3>

<p>Like most websites, STRATO Mercata may incorporate technology such as "pixel tags," "web beacons," and "cookies." Pixel tags or web beacons are tracking devices on websites or in emails that can monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the e-mail. Cookies (not to be confused with the sugary treat) are small files that web servers may place on your computer when you visit a website.</p>

<p>Here at STRATO Mercata, we use cookies to help identify and track usage of the Services and to make it easier to deliver a personalized experience. You can easily refuse our cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. However, be forewarned that disabling cookies may cause STRATO Mercata to not operate properly.</p>

<p>In order to improve and grow, STRATO Mercata may use your aggregated data to perform its own analytics and to enable analytics provided by third parties. Aggregated data includes user data reflecting or based on the access or use of the STRATO Mercata Products, platform visits, session, impression and clickstream data that is automatically collected, aggregated and anonymized by STRATO Mercata Products. We may use analytical information for business analysis, statistical or other pattern analysis, and operations purposes, business intelligence, product development, responding to users' support requests, improving products and services, personalizing content, providing advertising, and making recommendations. STRATO Mercata may also use third parties, such as Flurry, in order to develop and analyze use of the Services.</p>

<h2>Third Party Services</h2>

<p>We haven't built all of the features offered on our Services from scratch. To run the Services, we often utilize various third-party products (collectively "Third Party Services"), including, but not limited to AWS Cloud to create an instance of our blockchain solution on STRATO Mercata, credit bureaus, ID verification partners, blockchain data providers and analyzers, and advertising networks and analytics providers. Please note that your use of these Third-Party Services is governed by their respective Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. We use and disclose any collected information in accordance with our own Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Communication You Initiate with Us</h2>

<p>We do everything possible to make sure you have an amazing experience when using our Services. If you contact us in person, by phone, email, instant message, live chat, social media, or by some other means (either through our Services or through a Third-Party Service), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence for later reference (to help improve our Services!).</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information We Gather</h2>

<p>We primarily use the information we collect and store (i) to provide you with an efficient, secure, and smooth user experience and to create, develop, deliver, and enhance the Services, content and advertising; (ii) for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes; (iii) for enforcement of the terms in our user agreement and other agreements; and (iv) to maintain legal and regulatory compliance. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your Personal Information.</p>

</ul>

<h3>ChatGPT and Similar AI Technologies</h3>

<p>To enhance your user experience, we may include connectors that leverage so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as ChatGPT. To that end, like most website operators, ChatGPT.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. According to ChatGPT's Privacy Policy its purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ChatGPT.org's visitors use its website. From time to time, ChatGPT.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. ChatGPT.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://chatgpt.org/ blog posts. ChatGPT.org only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described in its Privacy Policy. Please read the ChatGPT Privacy Policy if you have further questions or concerns about how your data is managed in such a platform.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as with your use of any other website, refrain from entering any sensitive personal information on our website, or if directed to any third-party website, that you would not like to disclose to the universe. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites, products or services, including that of ChatGPT or other AI technologies.</p>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. By accepting this Privacy Policy, as outlined above, you consent to any such transfer.</p>

<h2>Protection of Us and Others</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to: comply with the law or a court order; cooperate with law enforcement; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of STRATO Mercata, our employees, our users, or others.</p>

<h2>What Personal Information Can I Access or Change?</h2>

<p>If you decide you don't want to receive email or other mail from us, you can select the "opt out" provision in our communications to unsubscribe. Unsubscribing will stop you from receiving most types of communication, but it may not apply to emails about orders or transactions you place through the Services or to respond to your specific request.</p>

<p>Presently it is not possible for you to change, alter, or amend Personal Information that you provide to us. If you would like to modify any Personal Information that you provide to us or delete this information, please contact us at any time at info@stratomercata.com.</p>

<h2>User Rights of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia Residents</h2>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), plus the Colorado Privacy Act ("CPA"), Connecticut Data Privacy Act ("CDPA"), Utah Consumer Privacy Act ("UCPA") and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act ("VCDPA") allow consumers in these states to opt out of certain sharing of their data.</p>

<p>As such, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia residents may request that STRATO Mercata:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disclose the sources, categories, and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them, how that information is used, and with whom STRATO Mercata shares it.</li>
<li>Disclose the purpose for collecting personal information.</li>
<li>Disclose the categories of third parties with whom STRATO Mercata shares personal information.</li>
<li>Delete/rectify/restrict their personal information, subject to certain exceptions (right of rectification not applicable to Utah residents).</li>
<li>Disclose, for any "sales" of personal information, the categories of personal information collected and sold and to what categories of third parties it was sold.</li>
<li>Opt them out of sales of their personal information (if any) or subject certain personal information to automated decision-making algorithms (not applicable to Utah residents).</li>
<li>Provide a copy of their personal information in a readily usable format that allows the information to be transmitted to others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents in these states may not be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described above.</p>

<p>California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia residents may exercise these rights by contacting STRATO Mercata at info@stratomercata.com.</p>

<p>We are legally obligated to verify your identity when you submit a request; thus, we may request additional information from you, like your date of birth or a personal identification number, to verify your identity. If we cannot verify your identity, we may deny your request.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>If you request that your information be deleted, we still may retain some Personal Information that you have provided to us in order to preserve our legal rights, continue performing our obligations, or comply with relevant laws.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>We are committed to making sure your information is protected and have selected third-party vendors that help keep your Personal Information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security.</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards and take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>

<p>If you log into your account on a shared computer, be sure to sign out of your account when finished. If you believe a third party has access to your account, you must let us know as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>We are especially sensitive about children's information. We're not a site targeted towards children, and we don't knowingly collect information from children under the age of 18. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using STRATO Mercata on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If we suspect that the user submitting personal information is younger that 18 years of age, we will require that user to close his/her account and will not allow the user to continue using our Services. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 18 has used STRATO Mercata, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at info@stratomercata.com.</p>

<h2>Online Tracking and How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h2>

<p>Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual's Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including STRATO Mercata, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.</p>

<h2>International Users and Visitors</h2>

<p>STRATO Mercata is hosted in the United States but operates globally. Because the Internet is global, you should note that by providing Personal Information as an international visitor or user, you are: (i) permitting the transfer of your Personal Information to, and storage in, the United States, which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside; and (ii) permitting the use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>STRATO Mercata protects your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed and take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect it under applicable laws. We ensure that the recipient of your personal data offers an adequate level of protection an
