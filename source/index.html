        <h2>Documenting Ethereum's Genesis</h2>
        <p>This is an ongoing project initiated by <a href="/people/bob-summerwill/">Bob Summerwill</a>, documenting the early days of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum project</a> and preserving the history and stories of the people who built the world's first smart contract platform.</p>
        <p>All contributions towards this public record are very welcome, via <a href="https://github.com/bobsummerwill/EarlyDaysOfEthereum/issues" rel="noopener">issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bobsummerwill/EarlyDaysOfEthereum/pulls" rel="noopener">pull requests</a>, or directly to Bob's <a href="https://x.com/bobsummerwill" rel="noopener">X</a> or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/bobsummerwill" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
        <p>Biographic information, photos, videos, links to contemporary articles and anything else which might be of interest to others researching Ethereum's history are all very welcome.</p>
        <p>At the very least, Bob intends to produce a coffee table book of these photos and memories, but also to gather a 'High School Yearbook' style profile on everybody mentioned here and perhaps even individual interviews (180+ of them!), whether text or audio/video for everybody. That would not be a small undertaking, but could be a lot of fun.</p>
        
        <h2>Back Story</h2>
        <p>This is a continuation of a 2017-2018 project in which <a href="/people/bob-summerwill/">Bob Summerwill</a> gathered information on the early contributors to the <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum project</a> and of people who were involved with the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation/">Ethereum Foundation</a> in its early years:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://bobsummerwill.com/ethereum-foundation-people/" target="_blank">Ethereum Foundation People</a> - released 31st March 2018</li>
            <li><a href="https://bobsummerwill.com/ethereum-foundation-timeline/" target="_blank">Ethereum Foundation Timeline</a> - released 4th May 2018</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Since the original information was first published, three books have been written on the history of Ethereum, which give a fuller story:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Machine-Crypto-hackers-Building-Internet/dp/0062886142/" target="_blank">The Infinite Machine</a> by <a href="/people/camilo-russo/">Camila Russo</a> - released 14th July 2020</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Money-Ethereum-Foundation-Revolution/dp/1119602939" target="_blank">Out of The Ether</a> by <a href="/people/matthew-leising/">Matthew Leising</a> - released 29th September, 2020</li>
            <li><a href="/articles/the-cryptopians" target="_blank">The Cryptopians</a> by <a href="/people/laura-shin/">Laura Shin</a> - released 22nd February 2022</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This content was combined with the <a href="/videos/">Early Days of Ethereum video series</a>.  The videos were initiated in late 2023 by
          <a href="/people/victor-wong/">Victor Wong</a>,
          <a href="/people/kieren-james-lubin/">Kieren James-Lubin</a>, and
          <a href="/people/james-hormuzdiar/">Jim Hormuzdiar</a>â€”the co-founders of
          <a href="https://blockapps.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockApps</a>.
          Bob joined as a guest in <a href="/videos/episode003-bob-summerwill.md">Episode 3</a> and became the host from <a href="/videos/episode004-taylor-gerring.md">Episode 4</a> onwards. A new episode is planned to be recorded each month, starting in September 2025.
