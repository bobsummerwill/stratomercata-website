In March 2014, Jarrad founded the [Amsterdam Ethereum Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Ethereum-Meetup/) which had its inaugural session at [Eetcaf√© de Doffer](https://cafededoffer.nl) on 4th March 2014 with 37 attendees.

There were three presentations that day:

- *Intro to Smart Contracts - Jarrad Hope*
- *Writing Smart Contracts - [Joris Bontje]('/people/joris-bontje/')*
- *Q&A - Jeff Wilcke*

*(The video of the meetup was published later that month on [EtherCasts](https://www.youtube.com/@EtherCasts), the channel created by [Joris Bontje]('/people/joris-bontje/') and [Joel Dietz]('/people/joel-dietz/'))*

By the second event in April the bar's occupancy was maxed out.

Jarrad did early work on [Trust Davis](https://github.com/EtherCasts/trustdavis) and contributed to [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum). In April 2014, he started work on an [ethereumj](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj) fork to add Android support, creating [ethereumj-android](https://github.com/status-im/ethereumj-personal/commit/1d3782c3be1e786da02b755dfd28a8c8b75b75f9).

In May 2014, he started work on [Syng](https://github.com/status-im/syng-client/commit/e0221e5ce2f106a2d4ed31d5f6c256c0824f6944) which later became [Status](https://status.app). He ceased his other work and went full-time on Ethereum during Q1 2015.  Syng was a recipient of a devgrant which was mentioned in [Wendell Davis]('/people/wendell-davis/')'s talk at DEVCON1:
