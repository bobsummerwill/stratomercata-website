*"Similarly, [Caktux]('/people/vincent-g/') an early volunteer and maintainer of the Ncurses-based C++ Ethereum front-end neth has been invaluble (alongside [Joris]('/people/joris-bontje/') and Nick Savers) in getting a continuous integration system up and running."* - Gavin Wood

*"Even though they are not on anyone's team, I like to thank [Nick]('/people/nick-savers/'), [Caktux]('/people/vincent-g/') and [Joris]('/people/joris-bontje/') for their ongoing effort in developing out our build systems. I'd also like to thank Nick specifically for pointing out the inconsistencies between our implementations: ~~Nick, you truly are a great pain in my ass (-;~~"* - Jeff Wilcke
