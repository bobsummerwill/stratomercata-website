As per his LinkedIn:

*"Founding Member, Ethereum" as per his LinkedIn profile."*

*"Founded Metamask (originally "Vapor"), two Ethereum related meetups, the Ethereum developer evangelism program (EtherCasts), and numerous early whitepapers on reputational systems and governance."*

Claimed dates: Dec 2013 to Aug 2014

Grok says ...

*"Joel Dietz, a self-described early cryptocurrency entrepreneur and intellectual historian, filed a lawsuit on August 1, 2023, in San Francisco Superior Court against Consensys (the blockchain software company behind MetaMask), Aaron Davis (a MetaMask co-founder), Dan Finlay (the other MetaMask co-founder), and Joe Lubin (Consensys CEO). The suit centers on allegations that Dietz originated the concept for MetaMask—a popular Ethereum-based browser wallet extension—through his earlier project called Vapor, and that the defendants conspired to steal the idea, exclude him from ownership, and erase his contributions from the project's history."*

*"As of the current date (September 15, 2025), the case remains ongoing, with Dietz seeking to recover what he claims is his rightful share of MetaMask's value (estimated at billions, given Consensys's $7 billion valuation in 2022). No major resolution or dismissal has been publicly reported in recent searches, though the case has drawn attention for highlighting early Ethereum-era disputes over intellectual property and partnerships in the crypto space. Key legal questions include whether a formal partnership existed (based on informal Slack messages and collaborations) and when Dietz should have discovered any alleged theft."*
