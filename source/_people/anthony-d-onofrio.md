Texture was the first "community guy", reading the White Paper as one of the very people outside of the initial set of recipients and having his mind blown:

*"I actually had envisioned everything in the paper before. I was more blown away by the fact that I found it and Vitalik a week after having the vision" - [Texture on Twitter, 29th August 2025](https://x.com/iamtexture/status/1961541627694219532)*


In mid-December 1013, Texture and [Vitalik]('/people/vitalik-buterin/') did a live-streamed "Salon Talk" to DCTRL, in Vancouver, BC ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

*"Texture (Anthony d'Onofrio) is spearheading community development for Ethereum in North America, he has written many works on Decentralized governance & community incubators."*

Texture gave two separate "OG" interviews in 2022:

In January of 2025, with dissatisfaction brewing around the Ethereum Foundation, Texture wrote an opinion piece in Coindesk signed off "With Love, Texture":

Love is a common theme for Texture, whose Medium account is:

He used to stand on street corners giving out "free hugs" from what I remember.  I'll have to ask him about that!

He posted this in 2018 on the fourth anniversary of the Miami beach house photo:

And, further down the thread he said this, with my own efforts at Maple Syrup diplomacy in full flood at that point:

And, a little later in the month in response to my epic "Calling for an End to Tribalism in Ethereum":

{% include twitter-embed.html url="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632" %}

I stuck that epic rant into blog form a few days later:

And that turned into my opening keynote at the very first [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io) in Paris a week and a half later:

Which I opened with the epic "Ethereum - Your Turn" with voiceover by the aforementioned Charles Hoskinson:
