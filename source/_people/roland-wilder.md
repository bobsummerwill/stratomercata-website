Aeron Buchanan said to Bob Summerwill in a personal email on 16th August 2018:*

*"Roland Wilder was brought on by [Sarah O'Neill]('/people/sarah-oneill'), who was the interior designer and renovation coordinator for the ethdev office. They were fantastic, making it happen on a small budget and on an accelerated timescale."*
